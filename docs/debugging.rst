Debugging IDAPython Scripts
===========================

While IDAPython is extremely useful, it can be a bit of a hassle to debug IDA Pro plugins.
This tutorial will give get you started on debugging IDAPython scripts and plugins
using Python Tools for Visual Studio.

And yes, it is completely free.


The Setup
---------

For this tutorial, we will be using the following software:

#. `IDA Pro 6.8`_
#. `Visual Studio Community 2013`_
#. `Python Tools for Visual Studio 2.1`_, documentation can be found `here <https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS/wiki>`_.
#. Python's ``ptvsd`` module. Install using ``pip install ptvsd``.
#. The following plugin:

    .. code:: python

        # filename: ptvsd_enable.py

        import idaapi
        import ptvsd

        try:
            # Enable the debugger. Raises exception if called more than once.
            ptvsd.enable_attach(secret="IDA")
        except:
            pass


        class DebugPlugin(idaapi.plugin_t):
            flags = idaapi.PLUGIN_FIX
            comment = "PTVSD Debug Enable"
            help = "Enable debugging using PTVSD"
            wanted_name = "PTVSD"
            wanted_hotkey = ""

            def init(self):
                return idaapi.PLUGIN_KEEP

            def term(self):
                pass

            def run(self, arg):
                pass


        def PLUGIN_ENTRY():
            return DebugPlugin()

For the purposes of this tutorial, you can try and debug this plugin:

.. code:: python

    # filename: sample_debuggee.py

    import idaapi


    def my_debugged_function():
        # Set breakpoint here!
        pass


    class SamplePlugin(idaapi.plugin_t):
        flags = idaapi.PLUGIN_PROC
        comment = "Sample Debuggee"
        help = "Sample Debuggee"
        wanted_name = "Sample Debuggee"
        wanted_hotkey = "Shift+D"

        def init(self):
            return idaapi.PLUGIN_KEEP

        def term(self):
            pass

        def run(self, arg):
            my_debugged_function()


    def PLUGIN_ENTRY():
        return SamplePlugin()


Debugging
---------

#. Put ``ptvsd_enable.py`` (provided above) in IDA's plugins directory.
   If you want to use the sample debuggee, put it in the plugins directory as well.
#. Start IDA and load an IDB (otherwise weird issues arise)
#. Load the code you want to debug into Visual Studio and set breakpoints.
#. In Visual Studio (with the plugin file open), use ``DEBUG->Attack to process``

    .. image:: media/debugging/debugging_menu.PNG


#. In the dialog, select ``idaq.exe`` and click ``Attach``

    .. image:: media/debugging/attach_dialog.PNG


#. We are now attached. Once a breakpoint is hit, Visual Studio will break and let you debug.

#. Have fun debugging!

Important Notes
---------------

#. When the debugging, IDA will be frozen.
#. Load your IDB prior to attaching the debugger.
#. For easy debug-on-demand, keep ``ptvsd_enable.py`` in IDA's plugins directory at all times.
#. To set breakpoints, make sure you load into VS the files that are actually loaded by IDA.
